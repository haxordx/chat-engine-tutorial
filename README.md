with PubNub Chat Engine.

# Set up tutorial with index.html, bootstrap, jQuery

Let's get started. In this tutorial, we'll be using:

- NodeJS
- Twitter Bootstrap
- jQuery
- PubNub Chat Engine

If you're not familiar with these, don't worry. They'll be helpful links along
the way.

## Install NodeJS

"Hey, I thought we were building a front end app!?"" We are, but if you haven't been keeping up to date, you might not have noticed that NodeJS has become the go-to option for working with javascript packages.

In this tutorial I'll be using NodeJS v6.11 which is the latest version as of this time of writing.

If you're using NVM (Node Version Manager), you can install this version by running ```nvm install v6.11```.

If you need help installing NodeJS, check out [this handy list of guides for every OS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

You can verify that you're running the correct version of NodeJS with by running ```node -v```.

## Install Twitter Bootstrap

Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery will make it easy for us to create user interface elements for our chat application.

In fact, when using PubNub Chat Engine, creating the UI and hooking it up to the framework is about all you have to do.

We'll use bootstrap 3 since it's the latest stable version. You can install it using npm by running ```npm install bootstrap@3```.
